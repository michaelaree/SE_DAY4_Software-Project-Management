4.In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile: Best for projects needing quick updates, like mobile apps.
Waterfall: Best for projects with strict requirements, like banking software.

5.What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Testing, code reviews, and user feedback help ensure quality. High standards make the software reliable, user-friendly, and reduce errors.

6.How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
A clear project scope helps avoid confusion and keeps the project on track. 
A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) divides tasks into smaller steps, making planning and tracking easier.

9.How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
A clear problem statement ensures the solution is well-designed and meets actual user needs.

10.How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
It simplifies a complex task, making it easier for users to achieve their goals efficiently.

11.What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
Unique features could include automation, better user experience, faster processing, or integration with other tools.

12.What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
Market research can show how many people need the software and how demand is expected to grow.

13.How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
